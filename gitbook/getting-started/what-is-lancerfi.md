# What is LancerFi?

LancerFi is a decentralized freelancing platform built on the Solana blockchain that brings Real World Services (RWS) on-chain. It enables secure, trustless transactions between clients and freelancers using blockchain technology.

## Core Concept

Traditional freelancing platforms require users to trust a central authority to hold funds and mediate disputes. LancerFi eliminates this need by using blockchain-based escrow, where funds are locked in smart contracts until project completion.

## How It Works

1. **Client Posts Project**: A client creates a project and funds the escrow with SOL, USDC, or X402
2. **Freelancer Applies**: Freelancers submit proposals for the project
3. **Client Selects**: The client chooses a freelancer and the funds are locked in escrow
4. **Work Completion**: The freelancer completes the work and submits it
5. **Payment Release**: Once approved, funds are automatically released to the freelancer
6. **Platform Fee**: A 1% fee is retained by the platform

## Why LancerFi?

- **Trustless**: No need to trust a central authority
- **Fast**: Built on Solana for near-instant transactions
- **Low Fees**: Only 1% platform fee (much lower than traditional platforms)
- **Secure**: Funds are locked in blockchain escrow
- **Transparent**: All transactions are on-chain and verifiable
- **Web3 Native**: Built for the decentralized web
